    <p>Traditionally, blintzes are associated with Shavuot. This is a traditional holiday breakfast for our family. Rolled pancakes filled with cheese, fruit or both, they make a delicious dessert.</p>
    <p>Sweet blintzes carry on the tradition of cheese and fruit fillings. Serve either with sour cream and powdered sugar, or maple or chocolate syrup.</p>
